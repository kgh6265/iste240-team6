<h1>Student Pulse</h1>
    <p>
        StudentPulse is a dynamic web application designed to formalize the creation of campus life activities at RIT Dubai. Instead of a system where administration decides all activities, StudentPulse empowers students to propose events and gather community backing. By utilizing a threshold model, the platform ensures that only events with verified student interest are moved to the administrative review phase.
