# Team 6 Assignment 1

StudentPulse is a dynamic web application designed to formalize the creation of campus life activities at RIT Dubai. Instead of a system where administration decides all activities, StudentPulse empowers students to propose events and gather community backing. By utilizing a threshold model, the platform ensures that only events with verified student interest are moved to the administrative review phase.
